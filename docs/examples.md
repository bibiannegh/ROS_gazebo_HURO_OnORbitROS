# Examples of Applications using OnOrbitROS

In this section you can find different examples that exploit OnOrbitROS functionalities. They can serve as a guide to develop your own application, based on these or from scratch.

## Template

A template package, called **package_template** has been created to allocate the basic functionalities of a simulation using OnOrbitROS. It serves as a guide to create custom applications from it. 

When the launch file is loaded the world with a 1U cubesat in the world, describing the ETS VII's orbit.

## ETS VII

The package **ets_vii** contains the simulation of the Japanese satellite ETS VII presented in

The project is launched with the following command, that loads the satellite with a robotic manipulator performing a trajectory after 10 minutes. It includes cartesian controllers to perform On Orbit Servicing tasks (for more information please refer to the previous article).
